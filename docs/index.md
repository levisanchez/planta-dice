# Planta Dice

## Introduction
This app proposal addresses challenges sometimes faced with the normal upkeep of plants. They require regular waterings to stay healthy and to thrive. In the high desert environment of New Mexico, outdoor plants can be particularly vulnerable to our exceptionally arid conditions. The Planta Dice (plant says) app helps to keep the user on schedule, and their plants happy, through smart phone notifications.

The Planta Dice app would remind people to water their plants on a regular basis. It would take into account whether the plants are inside or outside. If the plants are inside, the app will remind with a static frequency. If the plants are outside, Planta Dice app would reference the weather service to determine precipitation in the area and any expected in the near future. If precipitation requirements for the plants can be met by weather conditions, the app would not generate a reminder message for the user.
